<h4><em> <strong>1. Berliners are not Germans.</strong></em></h4>
<p> They’re a special breed all of their own. Berliners have about as much in common with, say, Bavarians as Londoners do with people from the north of England, or New Yorkers do with the southerners in their own country. </p>

<br/>

<h4> <em> <strong>2. For example: Berliners just aren’t as obsessed with punctuality as other Germans.</strong> </em></h4>
<p> Sometimes, they’re even late :O </p>

<br/>
<h4> <em> <strong> 3. Berliners don’t even speak German.</strong></em> </h4>
<p> Berlinerisch goes so much further than saying “Icke” and replacing “g” with “j” – it’s pretty much a whole language of its own. We vividly remember the final class in a German course after we’d not mastered, but *dealt with*, everything (we thought) the language could throw at us, and our teacher played a CD of Berlinerisch. Minds were blown; tears were shed; hopes were dashed.</p>

<br/>

<h4><em> <strong>4. One concept that Berliners don’t have their own word for is manners.</strong></em></h4>
<p> It’s not that they’re particularly rude, it’s just that holding the door open for others, and thanking people that do so, just aren’t things here. Back in London we would step over our fallen grandmother to make sure we got on the Tube, but we’d at least say a polite “sorry” as we did so.</p>
 <br/>
 
<h4> <em> <strong>  5.Berliners don’t care what you look like.</strong></em> </h4>
<p> You could be an überhipster with a sky-high beanie and painted-on meggings, or wandering the streets in your pyjamas, and Berliners will treat you with the same indifference that they do everyone else.</p>
